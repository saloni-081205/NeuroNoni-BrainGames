## 🙌 Inspiration

This website was inspired by [Codedex](https://www.codedex.io), a platform that gamifies learning to code through pixel-themed challenges.  
**NeuroNoni** is my personal take on that retro-gaming aesthetic, tailored to brain training and cognitive games.

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

Here are some exciting features planned for future versions of **NeuroNoni**:

- ✅ Full sign-up & login integration (e.g., with Firebase)
- 🎮 Addition of more games (Sudoku, Maze Solver, Trivia, etc.)
- 🧑‍💻 User profiles with custom avatars and game history
- 📈 Leaderboards to compare scores with other players
- 🎨 Pixel-themed dark mode toggle
- 🌍 Multi-language support (e.g., Hindi, Spanish)
- 📱 Progressive Web App (PWA) capabilities
- 🔊 Retro sound effects and music toggle
- 🧏 Accessibility enhancements for all users

Stay tuned for these awesome updates!
